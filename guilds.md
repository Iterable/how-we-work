# Guilds

A guild is a group of people who meet on a cadence with the purpose of pursue a specific mission.

* Many guilds will be formed to achieve a specific mission. This can include SMART goals with clear definition and exit criteria. Examples: A guild to decide on a second supported programming language.
* Other guilds will have a longer running purpose. It is important that these guilds still have a clearly defined mission, even though there may not be a singular end goal. Examples: A design guild, sharing best practices and tooling across engineering teams.
* Guilds will often include members from multiple teams, both within and outside of engineering. For example, a guild for HIPAA compliance may include someone from finance or legal, sales, as well as engineering and security.

## Some Examples

### Testing Guild

The Testing Guild works to improve the state of automated testing across engineering. The guild develops and champions common patterns and best practices, researches testing tools and frameworks, and develops infrastructure supporting efficient testing.

### Services Guild

The Services Guild is driving our move to a service oriented architecture built on Docker and Kubernetes. They are solving problems related to code organization, build and containerization, provisioning, and monitoring. The team has begun migrating parts of Iterable to the new architecture to serve as a pattern for engineers migrating their own services.

### Design Guild

The Design Guild aims to elevate the quality of our application and websites' visual design and UX by providing feedback, support, and inspiration.
