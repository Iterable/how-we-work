## Data Infrastructure

Data Infrastructure, aka "Big Fast Data," manages data about our customers' customers, including ingestion, validation, storage, and search. We are a back-end focused team, dealing with the nuts and bolts of data storage, streaming, and search. We own the ingestion pipeline receiving data through API endpoints or file uploads, cleansing that data, and storing it in Elasticsearch. We also deal heavily with streaming data between systems, using a mixture of RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Pulsar.

You can read about our ingestion architecture and get a feel for the work we do in the blog post [Scaling Data Ingestion with Akka Streams and Kafka](https://engineering.iterable.com/scaling-data-ingestion-with-akka-streams-and-kafka/).

## Data Science

The Data Science team works on the Intelligence Suite, using machine intelligence to unlock business value and drive engagement across channels by

- Elevating the level of regular tasks for marketers, freeing them from manually crafting tactics as they begin to trust the intelligent automation more
- Modeling the dynamic preferences of their audience more accurately and provide deeper, actionable insight into the efficacy of their campaigns across channels
- Engaging their users more meaningfully with personalized dialogue and engagement


We use Scala, Spark, and Python ecosystem on the Databricks-AWS platform as our tech stack
